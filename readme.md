# Coding Challenge As Part of a Coding Diploma I'm doing

## Content

This one of a series of coding challenges I've completed while doing a Coding Diploma course with [Itonlinelearning](https://www.itonlinelearning.com/).

## The Brief

The objectives and brief are below.
Activity: Simple Banking System
Objective: Create a simple banking system where users can manage their accounts.

### Instructions:

1.Setup the Project Structure:

- Create a new folder for your project.
- Inside the folder, create the following files:
  a. bankAccount.js: This file will contain the definition of the BankAccount class.
  b. index.js: This file will be the entry point of your program.
  c. index.html: This file will be where the user interfaces with your JavaScript

  2.Define the BankAccount Class:

- Open bankAccount.js.
- Define a class called BankAccount.
  Ad- properties such as accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance.
- plement methods for depositing (deposit), withdrawing (withdraw), and checking balance (checkBalance).

  3.Implement the Main Program:

- Open index.js.
- Import the BankAccount class from bankAccount.js.
- Inside index.js, create instances of BankAccount to represent different bank accounts.
- Demonstrate the usage of methods like depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance.
- Upload all your files to a web server ensuring that all the files are in the same directory.

  4.Testing:

- Run your program using Node.js to ensure that it works as expected.
- Test different scenarios such as depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking balance.
- When you open the application in a web browser:
  a. The banking system title should be displayed
  b. The JavaScript functionality should be accessible through the web browser console.

Once you have completed the instructions in this activity and have achieved the desired output, you can then add your code to your own GitHub repository to showcase your JavaScript skills. You may also see an example of how we achieved this mini project at our GitHub repository below.
